# Locomotion Python Package

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

As of 24 January 2020, the `locomotion` package has been converted for use on
Python 3.7.3. This module also requires the following python packages:
* Numpy (>= 1.16.2)
* Scipy (>= 1.2.1)
* Plotly (>= 4.4.1)
* Libigl (beta version, under development)

### Installing

The `pip` installation is a work in progress. In the meantime, the package can
be manually installed in your system.

#### Step 1: Adding `locomotion` to your Python Path

To access the `locomotion` package, you could either copy the `locomotion`
folder into your working directory, or add the package to your environment. To
do the latter, you may use the following methods in your terminal, replacing
`/PATH/TO/PACKAGE` with the directory containing the package:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/PATH/TO/PACKAGE
```

Note that this method will have to be repeated every time a new terminal window
is opened. An alternative to the terminal method would be to add the following
directly to the top of your python script, before any other imports:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/PATH/TO/PACKAGE')
```

You should now be able to `import locomotion` from your python shell.

#### Step 2: Compiling `extendedDTW.so` file

If `import extendedDTW` results in an `ImportError`, you will need to rebuild
the package to make it compatible to your system. To do so, perform the following
steps:
1. First, `cd` into the `locomotion` directory. Note that this is the
   `locomotion` folder in the package, not the package itself.
1. If there is an `extendedDTW.so` file in the directory, remove it.
1. Now, run `cd ../extendedDTW`
1. If there exists an `extendedDTW.so` file, remove it.
1. If there exists an `extendedDTW.c` file, remove it.
1. Run `setup.py` with the following command on terminal.
```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
1. The terminal log might show some warnings, but if it runs successfully, there
   should be a `extendedDTW.cpython ... .so` file in your current directory.
1. Rename this `.so` file to `extendedDTW.so`, and move it into the `locomotion`
   directory.

If all goes well, you should be able to run `import extendedDTW` in your Python
shell now.

#### Step 3: Check if the installation worked

To ensure that the package was installed properly, run the jupyer notebook
`installation_check.ipynb`, which is located in the main folder. Follow through
the notebook, which will run through the basic functions of the package. If the
package is installed properly, it should be able to generate a small sample
dataset and run the BDD on it.

## Data format

### File Format
The package accepts csv and tsv files. However, because it distinguishes between
tsv and csv by doing a simple check to see if tabs or commas are present in the
first (header) line, make sure to avoid using both delimiters in the header of
your data file. If your data must use both, you will need to edit the `get_raw_data`
function in `animal.py`. 

### Header Format 
The computations require X and Y coordinate data with corresponding column
titles in string format, so the coordinate data columns must be labelled "X" and
"Y", including the quotation marks. They can also be single quotes. 

### Information File Format 
The information about the animals are stored in a json file, which is required
to read in relevant data for each computation. The fields and format are as in
this sample entry below. Note that all times are in minutes. In general, avoid
using spaces in the field values.

```javascript
{
        "name": "NSS_01", //Can be anything. Make it unique
        "data_file_location": "/data/medaka/NSS_01.dat",
        //full path to the data file
        "animal_attributes": {
            "species": "Medaka", //species name
            "exp_type": "NSS", //experiment type
            "control_group": "True", //True or False
            "ID": "01" //number, but in quotations
        },
        "capture_attributes": {
            "frames_per_sec": 20, //integer
            "pixels_per_mm": 1.6, //float
            "dim_x": 200, //in mm
            "dim_y": 100, //in mm
            "start_time": 0, //in min
            "end_time": 10, //in min
            "baseline_start_time": 0, //in min
            "baseline_end_time": 2 //in min
        }
    }
```

To generate the info file, you can use `infosheetGenerator.py` provided along with
the locomotion package, which will populate a json file in the correct format by
prompting the user for each necessary piece of information. It should run
similarly to the following snippet.

```
Specify the directory the json file will be saved: /path/to/json/files/
Specify the json file name: sample.json
Write new file or append to an existing file? [w/a] w
Read in all data files in a directory or individual data files? [d/f] f
Specify the data file to read from: /path/to/data/files/SS_01.tsv
Required information for /path/to/data/files/SS_01.tsv...
Name: SS_01
Species: medaka
Experiment type: SS
ID: 01
Is this the control group? [y/n] n
Horizontal dimension of the capture area (in mm): 200
Vertical dimension of the capture area (in mm): 100
Pixels to mm ratio: 2.4
Frame rate (per second): 20
Experiment starts at (in min): 0
Experiment ends at (in min): 10
Baseline segment starts at (in min): 0
Baseline segment ends at (in min): 2
Do you want to add another file? [y/n] n
Wrote the information entered into /path/to/json/files/sample.json
```

## Using the Package

Once you import the `locomotion` package, you will need to first initiate animal
objects using the `locomotion.get_animal_objs` command, which returns a list of
animal objects with basic X and Y data from the data files.

The routines for calculating Behavioral Distortion Distance (BDD) are located in
the `trajectory.py` file and can be called by
`locomotion.trajectory.[routine_name]`.

Example script:

```python
import locomotion
info_file = "/path/to/animal_info.json"
animals = locomotion.get_animal_objs( info_file )
for a in animals:
  locomotion.trajectory.getCurveData( a )
variables = ['Y','Velocity','Curvature']
start_time, end_time = 0, 1
norm_mode = 'spec'
distances = locomotion.trajectory.computeAllBDD( animals, variables, start_time, end_time, norm_mode )
output_directory, outfile_name = "/path/to/outdir", "results"
sort_table, square_table = False, False
color_min, color_max = 0.1, 0.5
locomotion.write.postProcess( animals, distances, output_directory, outfile_name, sort_table, square_table, color_min, color_max )
```

Alternately, you can use the `computeBDD.py` script and follow prompts to run
comparisons among animals in a given info file by running `python computeBDD.py`
in your terminal, which should run similar to this sample snippet.

```
Specify the path to the json file with animal information: /path/to/animal_info.json
Use all entries in the info file? [y/n] y
Which variables do you want to use? (e.g., 'Y Velocity Curvature') Y Velocity Curvature
Specify the start time of the segment you want to compare: 0
Specify the end time of the segment you want to compare: 1
Which time segment do you want to normalize over: the predetermined baseline or the segment specified above? [b/s] b
Do you want to write the results into a file? [y/n] y
Specify the output directory: /path/to/outdir
Specify the output file name: results
Do you want to sort the output? [y/n] n
Do you want the distance table to be square instead of upper triangular? [y/n] n
```

To calculate the Intra-Individual Behavioral Distortion Distance (IIBDD) for each animal in a
specified info sheet, one can run a script like the following:

```python
import locomotion
info_file = "/path/to/animal_info.json"
animals = locomotion.get_animal_objs( info_file )
for a in animals:
  locomotion.trajectory.getCurveData( a )
variables = ['Y','Velocity','Curvature']
norm_mode = 'spec'
number_of_comparisons_per_animal, specified_durations = 100, None
output_directory, outfile_name = "/path/to/outdir", "results"
start_time, end_time = 0, 1
locomotion.trajectory.computeAllIIBDD( animals, variables, norm_mode, number_of_comparisons_per_animal, specified_durations, output_directory, outfile_name, start_time, end_time )
```

Alternately, you can use the `computeIIBDD.py` script and follow prompts to run
comparisons among animals in a given info file by running `python
computeIIBDD.py` in your terminal, which should run similar to this sample
snippet.

```
Specify the path to the json file with animal information: /path/to/animal_info.json
Use all entries in the info file? [y/n] y
Which variables do you want to use? (e.g., 'Y Velocity Curvature') Y Velocity Curvature
Specify the start time of the overall segment in which you want to run comparisons: 0
Specify the end time of the overall segment in which you want to run comparisons: 1
Which time segment do you want to normalize over: the predetermined baseline or the segment specified above? [b/s] b
Do you want to write the results into a file? [y/n] y
Specify the output directory: /path/to/outdir
Specify the output file name: results
```

The routines for calculating Conformal Spatiotemporal Distance (CSD) are located
in the `heatmap.py` file and can be called by `locomotion.heatmap.[routine_name]`.

Example script:

```python
import locomotion
info_file = "/path/to/animal_info.json"
animals = locomotion.get_animal_objs( info_file )
grid_size, start_time, end_time = 10, 0, 2
for a in animals:
  locomotion.heatmap.getSurfaceData( a, grid_size, start_time, end_time )
distances = locomotion.heatmap.computeAllCSD( animals )
output_directory, outfile_name = "/path/to/outdir", "results"
sort_table, square_table = False, False
color_min, color_max = 0, 0.2
locomotion.write.postProcess( animals, distances, output_directory, outfile_name, sort_table, square_table, color_min, color_max )
```

Alternately, you can use the `computeCSD.py` script and follow prompts to run
comparisons among animals in a given info file by running `python computeCSD.py`
in your terminal, which should run similar to this sample snippet.

```
Specify the path to the json file with animal information: /path/to/animal_info.json
Use all entries in the info file? [y/n] y
Specify the start time of the segment you want to compare: 0
Specify the end time of the segment you want to compare: 1
Specify the grid size for the heat map (in the same units as the x- and y-dimensions): 10
Do you want to write the results into a file? [y/n] y
Specify the output directory: /path/to/outdir
Specify the output file name: results
Do you want to sort the output? [y/n] n
Do you want the distance table to be square instead of upper triangular? [y/n] n
```
