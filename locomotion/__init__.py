animal.py is part of the locomotion package comparing animal behaviours, developed
to support the work discussed in the paper "Computational geometric tools for
modeling inherent variability in animal behavior" by MT Stamps, S Go, and AS Mathuru.

This python module initializes the locomotion package when you run `import locomotion`.
